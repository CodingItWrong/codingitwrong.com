Running your [local dev environment](Local-Dev-Environment) directly on the OS that runs the development machine.

There are a few different options for installing software packages:

* **Installers**: For Mac OS X and Windows, there may be a graphical installer to install the package.
* **Package Managers**: These allow easy installation of a wide variety of software packages from a single command-line interface. These are pre-installed in many Linux distros, and many Mac developers use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
* **All-in-One Environments**: These provide access to multiple related packages in one GUI executable. The best-known example is [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), which provides access to the Apache web server, MySQL, and PHP. These are convenient if they include everything you need, but if you're only using one component they can be overkill, and if you need to add additional software or extensions, they can be difficult to use. They can also tend to lag behind in version support.
* **Building From Source**: This can work when all else fails, but when something goes wrong it can involve a lot of troubleshooting C compiler errors.
