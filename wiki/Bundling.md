title: Bundling
---

* Concatenation
* Imports
	* Sass static import
	* ES6 static import
* Inlining images in CSS as data URLs
* Inlining critical path CSS in HTML
	* Use this especially for critical assets requires to get the page looking good
	* Not scripts tho?
* Image sprites
	* Data URLs preferred now?

Http/1.1 keep-alive
6 concurrent connections per origin

HTTP/2 should theoretically make bundling less necessary, but not yet - 

Webpack is popular for this
