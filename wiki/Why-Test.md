title: Why Test
---

Here are some common reasons given for [automated testing](Testing):

* Reduce bugs
  - Confirm nothing breaks when platform and dependencies are updated.
* Provide documentation
* Improve application design
  - Expose design flaws; "architectural pushback" (AiA)
  - Defer design decisions (Metz)
  - Write decoupled code (Martin)
* Support refactoring
  - Supports increasing abstractions (Metz)
  - Confidence to drastically evolve the app (AiA)
  - Clean messy code so you aren't slowed down by it anymore (Martin)
* In all of the above, the ultimate goal is to reduce costs of time and money (Metz)
