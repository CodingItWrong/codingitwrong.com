* **Cohesion**: the degree to which an object has one complete focus. A lack of cohesion can come from multiple less-related focuses or from one incomplete focus.
* **Collaborator**: an object that works with another object to accomplish its goals.
* **Composition**
* **Context-Independence**
* **Coupling**: when a change to one object requires a change to another.
* **Dependency**: knowledge that an object has about another object. An object must have some dependencies on its collaborators, but itâ€™s possible for an object to have more dependencies on another object that necessary.
* **Inheritance**
* **Interface**: 
* **Surface Area**
