title: Estimation
---

Whether you're assigning complexity points to a story or scoping a project in terms of iterations, here are factors to consider when estimating the complexity of a task:

Requirements

- Stability of requirements
- Turnaround time for requirements questions
- User types: external users, internal users, support, maintenance development
- Dependencies on other developers/teams' work being delivered

Architecture

- Third-party technology integration
- Developer's familiarity with technologies
- Stability of technologies
- Dependency upgrades
- Performance and throughput needs

The Code

- Testing needs: automated, manual, QA team coordination, user acceptance approach
- Data persistence
- Data pushes or synchronization
- Payment processing
- Search reliability
- Robustness of validation needed
- Robustness of error handling needed
- User interface: functionality, design
- API accessibility
- User accounts: third-party integration, locking, resetting, customer support
- Security: TLS, authorization, exploit protection, compliance
- Secondary behaviors: logging, auditing, notifications

Delivery

- Infrastructure setup
- Data import or migration
- Complexity of go-live
- Localization
