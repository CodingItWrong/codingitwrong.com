title: Cucumber
---
Cucumber is an acceptance testing framework that focuses on describing behavior in plain text. These plain text statements are then implemented in terms of code. This provides a nice conceptual separation between *what* to test and *how* to test it.

Cucumber is implemented in Ruby and is often used for testing Rails and other Ruby web applications.
