You can receive updates whenever there's a new blog post using the RSS technology.

CodingItWrong.com's RSS feed is at [codingitwrong.com/feed.xml](/feed.xml)

The RSS reader app I use is [Feedly](https://feedly.com/); it's free and works great on (at least) the web, macOS, iPhone, and Android.

To find RSS feeds to add to Feedly, I use the [Awesome RSS](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/awesome-rss/) add-on in Firefox to let me know when a page I'm viewing has an RSS feed, and easily add it to Feedly.
