## About Me

Did you know what you wanted to be when you grew up? Ever since Melissa Joan Hart made video games about her annoying little brother on _Clarissa Explains It All_, I knew I wanted to be a software developer. I love that I get the chance to do that all week. Software development, not making games about Melissa Joan Hart's brother.

## Experience

I've been writing software full-time for eleven years, working in technologies ranging from Java to PHP to Ruby to Objective-C. I've built many small and large web applications, including e-commerce systems, wikis, and intelligent search algorithms. I work anywhere between implementing and styling rich UIs back through building robust database schemas and web service client/server architectures.

## My Passions

- **Engineering**: Taking the craft of writing software seriously by applying principles that have been discovered over the decades, focusing on meeting needs, and writing code that will flex under the changes that come over time.
- **Visibility**: Helping all team members (developers, project managers, and clients) see at all times how a project is intended to proceed, how it's actually proceeding, and what can be done to adjust to meet client goals.
- **Tooling**: Finding or creating solutions to boilerplate problems so teams can focus on solving the problems that add value for their clients, instead of reinventing the wheel.
- **Sharing**: Writing reusable code, externalizing it in packages, and open-sourcing it whenever possible.
- **Training**: Helping development teams better learn their craft, and helping them decide together how they want to operate as a team to increase effectiveness.
- **Responsibility**: Taking ownership for what I commit to, doing whatever I can to meet that commitment, and letting people know as soon as possible if I can't.

## Open-Source
