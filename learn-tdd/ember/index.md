title: Learn TDD in Ember
---

{% include tutorial-intro.md %}

To see how TDD works in Ember, let's walk through a simple real-world example of building a feature. We'll be using Ember 2.8 and Mocha, a popular test framework for Ember. Each section of the article is linked to a corresponding commit in the [Git repo](https://github.com/learn-tdd-in/ember) that shows the process step-by-step. This tutorial assumes you have some [familiarity with Ember](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.8.0/) and with [automated testing concepts](/learn-tdd/concepts).

The feature we'll build is the age-old tutorial feature: creating a blog post.
