title: Learn TDD in Laravel
---

{% include tutorial-intro.md %}

To see how TDD works in Laravel, let's walk through a simple real-world example of building a feature. We'll be using Laravel 5.4, along with Laravel's BrowserKit package to give us user-interaction simulation against a separate test database. Each section of the article is linked to a corresponding commit in the [Git repo](https://github.com/learn-tdd-in/laravel) that shows the process step-by-step. This tutorial assumes you have some [familiarity with Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4) and with [automated testing concepts](/learn-tdd/concepts).

The feature we'll build is the age-old tutorial feature: creating a blog post.
