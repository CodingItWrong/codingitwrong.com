## Setting Up the Repo

We will be building off of the GitHub repo [rnweb-workshop-app](https://github.com/CodingItWrong/rnweb-workshop-app). It is a basic [Expo](https://expo.dev/) app with linting and autoformatting added.

Clone the repo locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CodingItWrong/rnweb-workshop-app.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ cd rnweb-workshop-app
$ yarn install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

For instructions for opening the app on a physical phone, Android Emulator, or iOS Simulator, see [Opening the app on your phone/tablet - Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/#opening-the-app-on-your-phonetablet)
