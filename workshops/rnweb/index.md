## Pre-Workshop Setup

Thank you for signing up for the workshop! Here are the steps you can go through in advance to ensure your local development environment is ready.

{% raw %}
## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- A way to run the Expo app. One of:
  - A physical Android or iOS device
  - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) for the Android Emulator
  - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for the iOS Simulator

## Setting Up the Repo

We will be building off of the GitHub repo [rnweb-workshop-app](https://github.com/CodingItWrong/rnweb-workshop-app). It is a basic [Expo](https://expo.dev/) app with linting and autoformatting added.

Clone the repo locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CodingItWrong/rnweb-workshop-app.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ cd rnweb-workshop-app
$ yarn install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

For instructions for opening the app on a physical phone, Android Emulator, or iOS Simulator, see [Opening the app on your phone/tablet - Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/#opening-the-app-on-your-phonetablet)

## More to Come!

Once you have the mobile app booting up, you're all set! On Thursday, October 27th in the workshop we will take it from here. See you then!
