## Setting Up the Repo

We will be building off of the GitHub repo [rtl-exercises](https://github.com/CodingItWrong/rtl-exercises). It is a basic React app with React Testing Library preconfigured.

Clone the repo locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodingItWrong/rtl-exercises.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ cd rtl-exercises
$ yarn install
```

Get an API key:

- Go to <https://api.outsidein.dev> and click the "Create API Key" button. A personal API key will be created for you and shown to you.
- Copy the API key. Open the file `src/api.js` and replace the value of the `API_KEY` variable with the API key.

## Trying It Out

Do the following to make sure your local installation is working:

- Run `yarn test`. You should see output like the following, including "Tests: 1 todo, 1 total":

- Run `yarn start`. The app should automatically open in your web browser.
- Once the app is launched, make sure you can see the example movies "Vertigo" and "The Sound of Music" listed.
- Type in a movie title and click Save. Confirm the movie is added to the list, with a yellow icon appearing to the right of it.
