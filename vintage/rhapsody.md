Apple settled on buying NeXT, Inc to acquire their NeXTSTEP operating system as the foundation for a new Macintosh operating system. NeXTSTEP provided the key architectural features needed in a new OS: preemptive multitasking, multithreading, and protected memory. Development of this new operating system was codenamed Rhapsody. There were several developer releases, followed by an initial commercial release called “Mac OS X Server” and targeted at server use. Rhapsody replaced the black-and-gray NeXTSTEP user interface with the “platinum” UI originally developed for Copland.

From within Rhapsody, Mac OS 8 could be booted in the “Blue Box” environment to allow running classic Mac OS software; both operating systems can run at the same, but they take the full screen and only one can be visible at a time. However, third-party developers pushed back on Apple, saying that this wasn’t sufficient to support their applications during the transition to Mac OS X. Apple would refine their strategy for backwards compatibility before their next OS release.
