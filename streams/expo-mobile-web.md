title: "Building for Mobile and Web with Expo"
---

We're rewriting the frontend of a link-saving app in [Expo](https://expo.dev/), a framework built on top of React Native. This will allow us to run the same codebase on Android, iOS, and the web.

## [Today's Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/codingitwrong) - Feb 25, 2022, 4 pm ET

Today is our first session on this project and we'll be focusing on setup. We'll set up:

- The Expo project itself
- Linting and autoformatting
- The navigation library, [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- The UI library, [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/)
- The "chrome" of the app, including dark mode support and a responsive sidebar
- Deploying the web app on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- Deploying the iOS app on TestFlight

If we have time left over, we'll get working on our first feature: login.

## More Info

The app we're rewriitng the frontend for is [Firehose](https://github.com/CodingItWrong/firehose-api), an open-source link-saving app. The backend of the app is a JSON:API written in Ruby on Rails.

We're building the app using the same architecture I successfully used to write the frontend for [Surely](https://surelytodo.com), a todo list app. I use it every day on iOS and web, and it works great!
