title: Untitled Manifesto About Computers [DRAFT]
---

Our goal is to to maximally utilize the potential of computers (hardware and software).

## 1. Beneficial to society

We will build computer systems that maximize value and benefit to users and society, and minimize harm to them.

- Focus primarily on providing value to users, not selling ads
- Honestly communicate capabilities and limitations
- Focus on technologies that provide demonstrated value over hype
- Enable users to do what they want instead of modifying their behavior
- Users are in control of settings and uses, instead of the technology assuming, nagging, or preventing users from what they want to do
- Protect privacy by using the minimal data from people, making it clear what data is used and why, and allowing users to easily opt out
- Look for and prevent ways that design decisions and encoded implicit biases disproportionately affect some groups over others
- Maximize how users can access and reuse their data and functionality

## 2. Sustainable organization and systems

We will build computer systems that are sustainable in terms of maintenance and computer organizations that are sustainable economically.

- Have a sustainable profit model
- Focus on long-term organizational sustainability over short-term returns
- Apply quality and maintainability practices

## 3. Kind to creators

We will treat those involved with the creation of computer systems with respect, engaging their work in a sustainable way

- Sustainable work hours
- Do not compromise on quality in order to meet a fixed time and scope

## 4. Efficient to the environment

We will use computing resources in an efficient way to minimize climate impact.

- Avoid technologies whose energy use is disproportiante to their value
- Use hardware that supports installing your own OS
- Use operating systems with long-term hardware support
