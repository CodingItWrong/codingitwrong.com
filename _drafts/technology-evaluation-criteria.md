title: Technology Evaluation Criteria
---

One of the benefits of working at a place like Big Nerd Ranch is the encouragement and support to learn new technologies. Now that I feel like I'm fairly established in Rails, I'm looking into other ways to broaden my technical experience.

The fact that I'm just now getting into Rails should make it clear where I fall in the adoption curve.

## Testability

Are unit and acceptance tests of code on this platform possible, supported, encouraged, and common?

## Foundation

Is the platform code itself stable, usable, secure, and flexible?

## Components

Are third party components available via a package manager, stable, interoperable, supported, and maintained? Are there broadly-accepted standard components?

## Code

Does the platform support writing code that conforms to good software engineering practices, like the single-responsibility principle, the law of Demeter, and the dependency inversion principle?

## Deployment

Can code be easily containerized or deployed to PaaS platforms? If database migrations are needed, are they automated?

## Upgradability

How easy is it to upgrade the platform, components, and underlying language?

## Market

Is this a platform that people already know, want to use, or want training on?
