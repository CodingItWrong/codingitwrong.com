- View: just markup output. For real.
- View object, view model, presenter: model-agnostic display logic. Multiple models out. Many in the Rails community call this a Presenter. Multiple models. View display logic not directly related to one model.
- Draper decorator: model-specific display logic
- Value objects: field-specific display logic. no one talks about this much, probably because ActiveRecord makes it hard.
- Policy Objects: for reads, especially permissions checks
- Query Objects: for complex queries
- Model: just the core concerns of the business object
