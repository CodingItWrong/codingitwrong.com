When I was applying for my current job at [Big Nerd Ranch](http://bignerdranch.com), one of the things they asked me to do was to prepare a ten-minute presentation on anything I would like. At my then-current job I had been thinking a lot about how to evaluate new technologies, so I decided to present on that. It was a lot of fun, so I thought I'd share my thoughts here as well.

When I hear about a new technology, I get really excited. It feels a little like this:



It's going to be a whole new universe of possibilities! But once I get past the tutorial and try to use the technology for real work, often times it feels more like this:



We've all had experience with a technology that didn't end up being all it was cracked up to be. It can be discouraging when it's a technology we got excited about. And when it's a technology that someone *else* picked for us, it can make you downright angry.



Is there a way to avoid these ups and downs of new technologies? Is there a way to get off the roller-coaster.



I think there is. I think the way off the roller coaster is to interrogate your technologies.



When I say interrogate, I mean to ask good questions about them.
