When I released my first side project, TypeLink, it actually got a fair number of users. This was way back in the days that there were few enough apps in the iOS App Store that every new app would show up on the home page of its category. Once I started charging money for the app, though, interest dropped, understandably.

Since then, I've learned about the concept of marketing; specifically, finding product-market fit. I'm not very wired to do this, though. In fact, I didn't realize it at the time, but the name of the company I formed to release TypeLink actually *means* "I want to build what I want to build even if there's not a market for it"--seriously! The company is named NeedBee, for "this app needs to be."

This has led to a feeling of tension over time, that if I really wanted my apps to succeed I would need to learn marketing. I don't really feel like I want to do that, though. So it's felt like I'm resigning my projects to second-best, that they won't ever really be successful.

But hang on a second. It's bad for me to build what I want, and it's good for me to change what I'm building to what other people want, even if I don't want it? Who says that's a good thing? This actually goes against one of my deepest beliefs: computers should be used to meet people's needs. If I'm able to build just the app I want, that's the bull's-eye on the target. And if software platforms have advanced far enough that I don't need to spend 40+ hours per week to maintain it, and therefore I don't need to subsidize its development by compromising its design so others will pay for it, that's a good thing.

One place this impulse comes from is the hacker spirit, as described in Steven Levy's book *Hackers*. Not "hackers" in the sense of "breaking into other people's computers," but in the sense of people who are excited about computers and can't help themselves getting in there and figuring out what they can do. That was the spirit of the MIT AI Lab and the Homebrew Computer Club. And that's the spirit we can still have today.
