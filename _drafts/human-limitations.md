We have:

- Limited knowledge: we can't know for sure. Changeable code
- Limited mental capacity: we can't keep infinitely detailed code in our heads. Simple code to understand and avoid dependencies, initial and regression testing
- Limited energy: we need sleep, I can't work infinitely long hours
- Limited emotional resiliency: ultimately how were treated at work will affect our abilities
- We will make mistakes
    - Watch test fail in case the test is wrong vs knowing in advance you understand
