- Common thread: concerns vs collaborators
- Each says the other is a junk drawer
    - Jason DHH reply
    - Bryan post/talk
- Why the different views of concerns and collaborators? Different views of what achieves productivity
    - DHH is focused on readability, and modules/concerns are good for that: smaller files, logical groupings, simple calling syntax
    - Classical OO folks are focused on modularity, and modules/concerns don't help with that, because it's still one huge model, with no protections for how things access each other
        - Sandi "nothing" video on modules not being good enough
- Do you have to pick one or the other? It's a tension to manage. That's what it means to be a senior developer: to know when to apply different principles and when not to.
- My recommendations:
    - Start with the Rails standards
    - Evolve your architecture in an agile way
    - Know these patterns so you can identify a need to refactor when it arises
    - Make exemplary code so others on the team will follow
