title: Highlights from Vintage Computer Festival Southeast 2023
---

Last weekend I went to my first vintage computer festival: Vintage Computer Festival Southeast 2023.

There are a number of Vintage Computer Festivals around the US throughout the year. Check out the [VCF web site](https://vcfed.org/) for a list.

Here are some of the highlights of what I saw.

An IMSAI 8080, by an early company that sold a ton of computers but then burned out.

Next, a few well-known computers:

A dark-gray Apple II produced in partnership with Bell & Howell--I'd never heard of that before.

![A machine running Visi On.](/img/posts/vintage-computer-festival-2023/visi-on.jpg)

A machine running Visi On, an early GUI I have yet to dive into the history of.

Next, a variety of Macs that brought back nostalgia:

![A IIsi.](/img/posts/vintage-computer-festival-2023/macintosh-iisi.jpg)

A IIsi.

![A Power Macintosh 9600.](/img/posts/vintage-computer-festival-2023/power-macintosh-9600-200.jpg)

A Power Macintosh 9600. Why did they make these with the green button to open the side of the case? Who thought this looked good? Is it infected with "The Ooze"?

![128k Macintosh.](/img/posts/vintage-computer-festival-2023/macintosh-128k.jpg)

An original 128k Macintosh! The owner said the "D" is the logo of a university that placed an early order for 100 Macs, and Steve Jobs delivered them himself.

And now, the coolest thing I found:

![Apple Lisa](/img/posts/vintage-computer-festival-2023/apple-lisa.jpg)

A working Apple Lisa! Proof I was there, and a video of using the GUI. So interesting how much it's like Macintosh (even with multiple apps!), and yet not quite.

Here's a video of the GUI in action:
