In January I'll begin a new live stream series where we build an app for both web and mobile using the same codebase. Watch the video above to learn more, and follow me using any mechanism listed at the top of [my home page](/) to be notified when the streams will be starting!

To try out the previous app I built for both web and mobile, check out https://surelytodo.com â€” it's completely free to sign up and use.
