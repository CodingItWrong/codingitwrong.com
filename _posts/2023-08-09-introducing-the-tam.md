title: "Introducing the TAM"
---

While watching the [*Love Notes to Newton*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxRi34PqWo) documentary, I saw a Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh (TAM) prominently featured in the backdrop of one interviewee's house. Immediately I was like "I need to put my TAM in my backdrop too!"

This was the straw that broke the camel's back; a lot of other factors recently have made me think about getting it out:

* Blogging about [Growing Up Mac](2023/08/06/growing-up-mac) and wishing I had a photo of my own TAM for it
* Going to [VCF East](https://vcfed.org/events/vintage-computer-festival-east/) and planning to go to this Saturday’s [Atlanta Historical Computing Society](https://www.atlhcs.org/) and wanting to show and tell about my TAM.
* Some random mentions of TAMs on [BitBang.social](https://bitbang.social)
* Watching Action Retro's videos about restoring and modding a TAM. Not that I’m going to do anywhere *near* that level of modding, but it gives me the confidence “if he can do *that*, I can at least install some RAM.” Plus, it’s helped me get the vision for incrementally improving a machine, even if some steps don’t work out right away.
* Also from Action Retro, realizing that the fact that I’m the original owner means it’s in really good shape. It’s a waste to just leave a machine in such good state in a box, especially if it risks its condition deteriorating without me knowing it.
* The sense from *Love Notes to Newton* of a community of people using an old technology they love. It’s not a coincidence that one of the Newton fans is a TAM fan too. I’d like to participate in a community like that.

So here it is! For all to see in my Zoom backdrop. I'll share more about the state of it soon.
