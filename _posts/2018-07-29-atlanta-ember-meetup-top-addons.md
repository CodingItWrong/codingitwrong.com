title: Atlanta Ember Meetup: Top Addons
---

At the Atlanta Ember meetup in July we talked about the addons we tend to use most commonly. There wasn't always a consensus, but here are the most common addons or categories. I've linked to their pages on [Ember Observer](https://www.emberobserver.com/) since it's the most comprehensive place to get information on Ember addons.

- [ember-simple-auth](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-simple-auth) was used universally for authentication.
- [ember-cli-mirage](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-cli-mirage) was popular for creating a fake API Server for testing.
- [ember-cli-deploy](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-cli-deploy) was used by everyone except for one person using the [Heroku ember buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-emberjs); Heroku has a different deployment mechanism, so it doesn't go through ember-cli-deploy.
- [ember-moment](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-moment) was popular for date handling, as it is across all of JavaScript.
- [ember-changeset](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-changeset) allows form data entry without immediately updating models in the store.
- Support for a stylesheet language, like [ember-cli-sass](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-cli-sass) or [ember-cli-less](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-cli-less)
- A CSS framework addon: [ember-bootstrap](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-bootstrap) and [ember-paper](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-paper) were popular.
- "Power" components were popular for more advanced form controls: [ember-power-select](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-power-select), [ember-power-calendar](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-power-calendar), and [ember-power-datepicker](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-power-datepicker).
- [ember-concurrency](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-power-select) was recommended for when you have to write your own promises.
- [ember-composable-helpers](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-composable-helpers) and [ember-truth-helpers](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-truth-helpers) were popular for more advanced logic in your template.
- There are many addons for form validation; the two most recommended options are currently [ember-cp-validations](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-cp-validations) and [ember-changeset-validations](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-changeset-validations).
