title: Message to US Representative Hank Johnson
---

Congressman Johnson, as a constituent of GA district 4 I’m calling to urge you to sponsor and support the resolution to impeach and remove President Donald Trump from office.

The president has betrayed our country by pressuring our GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the results of the election, and by inciting a violent mob to obstruct congress certifying the outcome of a legal election.

If such conduct is not met with consequences it sends a message that it is acceptable for a president to contest elections in this illegal way, which undercuts the foundation of our democracy. And each day he remains in power is another day he can cause more such grievous harm to our nation.

I urge you to stand with the many representatives of both parties who are defending our democracy, and to impeach President Trump for these anti-American acts. The US Capitol was invaded—our democracy itself is in jeopardy. The the most important thing you ever do to defend our country may be this, to stand today as a bulwark against tyranny.
