title: "How We Got Here: Trump's Mishandling of the Coronavirus Pandemic"
---

As of March 27, [reported US cases of COVID-19 surpassed every other country in the world](https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1243314620737236992). Our [rate of growth of cases is higher](https://twitter.com/Laurie_Garrett/status/1243296025651154951) too.

This is a record of the role President Donald Trump played in bringing this about. I plan on keeping it up-to-date with the most significant facts; please feel free to send any (or any corrections) along to me at [@CodingItWrong](https://twitter.com/CodingItWrong) or virus[at]codingitwrong[dot]com.

Did "nobody see this coming?" No, there's plenty that the Trump administration could have done to better prepare:

Trump actively downplayed the severity of the virus throughout February and March:
- Feb 24: "Very much under control". [[link]](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1232058127740174339)

- Mar 9: more die from the common flu annually. Nothing is shut down, life goes on. [[link]](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237027356314869761)
- Mar 18: insists he always treated the coronavirus very seriously. [[link]](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1240243188708839424)

Ridiculed journalists instead of answering their questions about the virus:
* "Don't be a cutie-pie." [[link]](https://twitter.com/KenDilanianNBC/status/1243672477844324352)
* "No one is talking about this except you, which doesn't surprise me…I'm not hearing it." [[link]](https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1241056026872426496)
* "I say you're a terrible reporter." [[link]](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1241042158569676800)

Treated the pandemic as reality TV:

- "Incredibly interesting…everybody is going crazy, they're going crazy, they can't get enough of it." [[link]](https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1245134235964452866)

Gave medical advice to take unapproved hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to treat COVID-19:

Suppresses criticism:
* Interrupting White House meetings that challenge the facts as he sees them. [[link]](https://twitter.com/joelockhart/status/1242204717926830092)
* Threatens news stations that criticize him. [[link]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/trump-campaign-s-threat-on-tv-licenses-may-be-mostly-bluster)
* Issued cease and desist for playing an ad critical of Trump. [[link]](https://twitter.com/briantylercohen/status/1242974655293435907)
* Calling out governors for shortcomings on Twitter. [[link]](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241760294776561667)

Referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus," racist language that puts Chinese people at risk of hate crimes:

- <https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1243034967514415105>

Minimized the need for medical supplies, encouraged states to get them themselves, then outbid them, and conditioned giving supplies on governors "being appreciative" to Trump:
* Suggests Cuomo exaggerating how many ventilators are needed. [[link]](https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1243355519818928128)
* Refused to release a stockpile of 20,000 ventilators. [[link]](https://www.rawstory.com/2020/03/release-the-ventilators-gov-cuomo-publicly-begs-trump-to-stop-hoarding-20000-ventilators/)
