NeXTSTEP was the operating system built for NeXTâ€™s computers. Originally it ran only on NeXT hardware, but as those computers struggled to find a market, NeXTSTEP was ported to other processors as an attempt to increase the installed base of the operating system and attract developers. Eventually NeXT left the hardware business and focused on the NeXTSTEP software as their sole product. NeXTSTEP was one of the operating systems Apple looked into purchasing once their attempts at building their own next-generation operating system in-house had failed. NeXTSTEP was eventually chosen, and its code serves as the foundation of macOS to this day. When programming for macOS, many classes and constants have a prefix NS, which stands for NeXTSTEP.
