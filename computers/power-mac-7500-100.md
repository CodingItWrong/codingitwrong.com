- Released: August 8, 1995
- Processor: 100 MHz PowerPC 601

The 7500 was part of a second generation of Power Macintosh computers and was introduced at the 1995 MacWorld Expo along with the lower-end 7200 desktop and [8500 tower](./power-mac-8500-120). This generation of Macs were the first to use the PCI expansion card technology instead of the previous NuBus card slot. It introduced a new case design for easy access to internals that was reused by the future 7300 and 7600 models and by the beige Power Macintosh G3 desktop.
