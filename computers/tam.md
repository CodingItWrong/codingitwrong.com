Released to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of Apple Computer (founded in 1977), the The Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh features a compact design rare in the day, as well as integrated Bose speakers and subwoofer and the ability to play analog video feeds. It originally retailed for $7499, and was criticized for outdated technical specs for such a high price point. The price was later dropped to $3500, then $1995.
