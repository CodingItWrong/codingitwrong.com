- This model:
  - Released: August 5, 1997
  - Processor: 300 MHz PowerPC 604e

The Power Macintosh 9600 was part of the last line of Macintoshes released before the upgrade to the G3 processor. Its beige case features blue-green details that later found full expression in the Bondi Blue iMac. The case is notable for being easy to open and for providing twelve RAM slots and six PCI slots for a very high level of expandability. Although the first Power Macintosh G3 tower used the same beige case, it had significantly fewer RAM slots and PCI slots, leading to an extended life for the 9600.

The 9600 is able to run [Rhapsody developer releases](./rhapsody), as it was the high-end tower available at the time of Rhapsodyâ€™s release. Although earlier 9600s are able to run [BeOS](./beos), this 300 MHz model is based on a revised logic board that Be Inc said will probably not work.
